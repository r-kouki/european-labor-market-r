From a job seeker’s perspective, this means during economic expansions (low unemployment), there are more open positions available. The relationship isn’t perfect because structural factors also matter—skills mismatches can cause high unemployment and high vacancies simultaneously."

    "text": "5.5 COVID-19 Structural Break Analysis\nResearch Question: Did COVID-19 cause a measurable acceleration in ICT employment growth?\nThe pandemic of 2020 dramatically accelerated digital transformation across Europe. We test whether this represents a statistically significant “structural break” in the ICT employment trend.\n\n\nView structural break test code\n# Structural break test: interaction between time and COVID period\neu27_covid &lt;- panel_stats |&gt;\n  filter(geo == \"EU27_2020\", !is.na(ict_share_pc_emp)) |&gt;\n  mutate(covid = ifelse(year &gt;= 2020, 1, 0))\n\nif (nrow(eu27_covid) &gt; 5) {\n  model_break &lt;- lm(ict_share_pc_emp ~ year * covid, data = eu27_covid)\n  break_summary &lt;- broom::tidy(model_break)\n  \n  knitr::kable(\n    break_summary,\n    digits = 4,\n    caption = \"Structural Break Regression: COVID-19 Impact on ICT Growth\",\n    col.names = c(\"Term\", \"Estimate\", \"Std Error\", \"t-statistic\", \"p-value\")\n  )\n}\n\n\n\nStructural Break Regression: COVID-19 Impact on ICT Growth\n\n\nTerm\nEstimate\nStd Error\nt-statistic\np-value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-226.7905\n16.0515\n-14.1290\n0.0000\n\n\nyear\n0.1143\n0.0080\n14.3574\n0.0000\n\n\ncovid\n-112.3095\n26.6646\n-4.2119\n0.0040\n\n\nyear:covid\n0.0557\n0.0132\n4.2207\n0.0039\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation: The interaction term (year × covid) is statistically significant (p = 0.0039), indicating that COVID-19 caused a genuine acceleration in ICT employment growth. The slope increased by approximately 0.0557 percentage points per year after 2020. This confirms what many of us experienced—the pandemic didn’t just temporarily shift work online, it fundamentally accelerated the structural growth of tech employment in Europe."

    "text": "5.6 Statistical Summary\n\n\n\n*Note: *** indicates p &lt; 0.05 (statistically significant), ns = not significant*\n\n\nBottom Line: The statistical tests confirm what the visualizations suggest: ICT employment is genuinely growing, tech sector demand exceeds overall economy demand, and countries with more tech jobs tend to have higher earnings. These aren’t just visual patterns—they’re statistically robust findings that can inform career and policy decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote📊 Key Statistical Conclusions\n\n\n\nAll tests show highly significant results (p &lt; 0.05), confirming that:\n\n✅ ICT employment is genuinely growing (not random) — Linear regression shows consistent +0.166 pp/year growth with R² = 0.98\n✅ Tech sector has persistently higher vacancy rates — Paired t-test confirms tech vacancies exceed overall economy by ~0.8%\n✅ Countries with more tech jobs have higher overall wages — Pearson correlation r = 0.63 (strong positive relationship)\n✅ Standard labor market dynamics apply (Beveridge curve) — Classic inverse relationship confirmed (r = -0.95)\n✅ COVID-19 caused a measurable acceleration in ICT growth — Structural break test shows +0.056 pp/year additional growth post-2020 (p = 0.004)\n\nImplication: These findings provide robust statistical evidence supporting continued investment in digital skills and tech sector development across the EU."
