## Why This Matters

::: {.incremental}
- Digital transformation is reshaping European labor markets
- Growing demand for ICT specialists across all sectors
- Policy decisions require evidence on workforce evolution
- Understanding gaps between education and employment
:::

::: {.notes}
The European tech job market has experienced significant changes over the past decade, with implications for education, immigration policy, and economic competitiveness.
:::

## Research Questions

1. How has ICT employment evolved across the EU?

2. What is the relationship between unemployment and vacancies?

3. How do vacancy rates differ across sectors?

4. Is the education pipeline meeting market demands?

5. What factors correlate with higher ICT employment?

## Data Overview

| Indicator | Source | Coverage |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| ICT Employment | isoc_sks_itspt | 2014-2024 |
| Unemployment | une_rt_a, une_rt_m | 2014-2025 |
| Job Vacancies | jvs_a_rate_r2 | 2014-2024 |
| Graduates | educ_uoe_grad02 | 2014-2023 |
| Earnings | earn_ses_pub2s | 2014, 2018, 2022 |

**Source**: All data from Eurostat

## ICT Specialists: Growing Share

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
![](../outputs/figures/fig01_ict_share_trend.png){width="100%"}
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
**Key Finding:**

EU27 ICT employment share grew from **`r round(eu27_first$ict_share_pc_emp, 1)`%** (`r eu27_first$year`) to **`r round(eu27_latest$ict_share_pc_emp, 1)`%** (`r eu27_latest$year`)

*Consistent upward trend across the decade*

## Job Vacancies: Tech Sector Leads

```{r}
fig_path <- file.path(project_root, "outputs", "figures", "fig03_vacancy_rate_J_trend.png")
if (file.exists(fig_path)) {
  knitr::include_graphics(fig_path)
} else {
  cat("*Job vacancy data not available from Eurostat API*")
}
```

::: {.fragment}
**Information & Communication sector shows persistently high vacancy rates**

## Beveridge Curve: Labor Market Dynamics

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
```{r}
fig_path <- file.path(project_root, "outputs", "figures", "fig04_unemp_vs_vacancy.png")
if (file.exists(fig_path)) {
  knitr::include_graphics(fig_path)
} else {
  cat("*Beveridge curve data not available*")
}
```
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
**Interpretation:**

- Movement along curve: cyclical changes
- Shift of curve: structural changes
- Recent years show tighter labor market

## Graduate Pipeline

```{r}
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 5
if (file.exists(file.path(project_root, "outputs", "figures", "fig05_graduates_ict_vs_eng.png"))) {
  knitr::include_graphics(file.path(project_root, "outputs", "figures", "fig05_graduates_ict_vs_eng.png"))
} else {
  cat("Graduate trend figure not available")
}
```

## Earnings & ICT Employment

```{r}
if (file.exists(file.path(project_root, "outputs", "figures", "fig06_salary_vs_ict_share.png"))) {
  knitr::include_graphics(file.path(project_root, "outputs", "figures", "fig06_salary_vs_ict_share.png"))
}
```

::: {.fragment}
**Countries with higher ICT shares tend to have higher median earnings**
:::

## Work-Based Learning

```{r}
if (file.exists(file.path(project_root, "outputs", "figures", "fig07_wbl_exposure_bar.png"))) {
  knitr::include_graphics(file.path(project_root, "outputs", "figures", "fig07_wbl_exposure_bar.png"))
}
```

## Key Findings

::: {.incremental}
1. **ICT employment growing** steadily across EU27

2. **High vacancy rates** in tech sector indicate talent shortages

3. **Country heterogeneity** - Nordic countries lead in ICT shares

4. **Positive correlation** between ICT employment and earnings

5. **Graduate numbers increasing** but demand remains strong
:::

## Limitations

- Data availability varies by indicator and country
- Methodological changes may affect comparability
- Cross-sectional correlations ≠ causation
- EU27 aggregates mask within-country variation

## Policy Implications

::: {.incremental}
- **Education investment** in digital skills justified by persistent vacancies

- **Targeted policies** for countries with lower ICT employment

- **Work-based learning** programs to bridge education-employment gap

- **Cross-border mobility** to address regional imbalances
:::
